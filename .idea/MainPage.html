    <p>Mussa was “officially” born on 18.07.2006 he was the hidden child of the Emperor of atlantis but during his birth he got lost in the echoes of war with the Shrimp or Shrink a deadly under sea mafia of shrimp and a long term enemy of atlatnis. Ruin was inevideble Shrimp or Shrink was just to powerful so the emperor ordered his sole heir to be evacuated and in those hard times he somehow made his way to ancient Austria helping with the creation of the foundation of the Austrian-Hungaryen Monarchy but he himself did not want to ascend the throne he had another mission he travelled the lands not tying himself down anywhere which is also the reason many believe him to be Russian but he is on a Quest to rebuild the Kingdom of his regaining full dominion over the seas again and finally getting revenge on Shrimp or Shrink so he wanders in hopes of finding reminants of his home and maybe even survivors?</p>
